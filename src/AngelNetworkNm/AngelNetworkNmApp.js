              Some of the student startups at initial stages require little
              amount of capital to take things off-ground. This becomes a
              barrier and at times a significant one for some of them which can
              refrain their startups from going places. We donâ€™t want this to be
              a cause and hence are looking to build a fund of INR 15 Lakhs that
              can be used to nurture student startups.

              Not every student startup will have this requirement but for those
              who do, this should not pose a challenge or seen as a limitation.
              Some of the ways through which these funds can be useful for
              startups are :<br />
              To onboard some interns that can help the founder assist with a
              skillset that he/she might not have
              <br />
              For initial MVP development both from technical and physical point
              of view
              <br />
              For gaining initial traction onto the product or a service and
              that this could really help them go through
              <br />
              These are specific to the domain the startups are operating in and
              hence we want to have room to accommodate those
